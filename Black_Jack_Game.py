"""
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino card game where players compete against the dealer rather than each other. The objective is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

### Basic Rules:
1. **Card Values:**
   - Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
   - Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10 points.
   - Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value is more favorable for the hand.

2. **Starting the Game:**
   - Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards.
   - Playersâ€™ cards are dealt face up, while the dealer has one card face up (known as the "upcard") and one face down (the "hole card").

3. **Objective:**
   - The goal is to have a hand value of 21 or as close as possible without exceeding it ("busting").
   - Players aim to beat the dealer by having a higher hand value or by the dealer busting.

4. **Gameplay Actions:**
   - **Hit**: Request another card from the dealer. You can keep hitting as long as you donâ€™t bust.
   - **Stand**: Keep your current hand and end your turn.
   - **Double Down**: Double your original bet, receive only one more card, and then you must stand.
   - **Split**: If the first two cards are of equal value (e.g., two 8s), you can split them into two separate hands, placing a second bet equal to the first.
   - **Surrender**: Some versions allow players to surrender after the first two cards, reclaiming half of their bet and forfeiting the round.

5. **Dealer's Turn:**
   - After the players finish their actions, the dealer reveals their hole card.
   - The dealer must hit until their hand totals at least 17 (in most versions of the game).
   - If the dealer exceeds 21, they bust, and all players who didnâ€™t bust win.

6. **Blackjack:**
   - A "blackjack" is an Ace and a 10-point card on the initial deal. It typically pays out at 3:2 odds.
   - If both the player and dealer have blackjack, itâ€™s a push (tie), and the bet is returned.

7. **Insurance:**
   - If the dealerâ€™s upcard is an Ace, players can choose to place an insurance bet (usually half of the original bet). This pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack.

8. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Players win by having a higher hand total than the dealer without busting.
   - A player also wins if the dealer busts.
   - If the player busts or has a lower hand total than the dealer, they lose.

Blackjack blends strategy, probability, and luck, making it a favorite for many casino players.
